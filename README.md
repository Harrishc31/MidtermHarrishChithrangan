I added a orange-ish/dusty color correction to the biker1 and 2 models to show that it is in a desert environment.

I added a red rim light around the "Biker1 (BurnOut) " model to show that it is over heating from accelerating too much.

The yellow hologram sphere was something I added because I would love to imagine this game having an item/coin system like mario kart.


I got the textures from the Unity Asset Store. This is the link to the textures I used:
